# Worker Invitation Navigation Fix

## Issue Description
When a user accepted or rejected a "Worker Invitation", they were not being properly redirected to the appropriate dashboard. The navigation logic was flawed and inconsistent. Additionally, a context disposal error could occur if navigation or Provider access happened after the widget was disposed.

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Complex Role Detection Logic**
The original code tried to get the user's role from AuthService immediately after accepting/rejecting:
```dart
final authService = Provider.of<AuthService>(context, listen: false);
final rawRole = authService.currentUser?.role;
final roleString = (rawRole is String) ? rawRole : /* complex conversion logic */;
NavigationService.instance.navigateToDashboard(context, roleString.toString());
```

### 2. **Timing Issues**
- After accepting an invitation, the user's role is updated in the database
- But the AuthService might not have refreshed the user data yet
- This caused navigation to the wrong dashboard

### 3. **Inconsistent Navigation**
- Both accept and reject used the same logic to determine navigation
- No clear distinction between what should happen for each action

### 4. **Context Disposal Error**
- If navigation or Provider access happened after the widget was disposed (due to async operations), a runtime error occurred:
  - `DartError: Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe.`

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Robust Navigation and User Choice**
After accepting an invitation, the user is now shown a dialog with two options:
- **Continue as Worker**: Redirects to the worker dashboard immediately
- **Logout & Login Again**: Logs out and redirects to login for full privilege refresh

This avoids forced logout (which could cause context disposal issues) and gives the user control.

### 2. **Context Safety**
- All Provider services (AuthService, WorkerInvitationRepository) are captured before any async operations
- All UI operations after async calls are protected with `context.mounted` checks

### 3. **Simplified Navigation Logic**
```dart
// After successful invitation acceptance:
if (context.mounted) {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    ... // Dialog with two options
  );
}
```

### 4. **Troubleshooting Note**
If you see `DartError: Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe`, ensure:
- All Provider lookups are done before async/await
- All navigation and UI operations after async calls are wrapped in `if (context.mounted)`

## Implementation Details

### Accept Invitation Flow:
1. ✅ User accepts invitation
2. ✅ Repository updates invitation status to "accepted"
3. ✅ Repository updates user role to "worker" in users collection
4. ✅ Repository creates worker document in workers collection
5. ✅ UI shows success dialog with two options
6. ✅ User chooses to continue as worker (redirect to dashboard) or logout (redirect to login)

### Reject Invitation Flow:
1. ✅ User rejects invitation
2. ✅ Repository updates invitation status to "rejected"
3. ✅ User remains a customer (no role change)
4. ✅ UI shows rejection message
5. ✅ UI navigates to customer dashboard (`/dashboard` → `CustomerDashboard`)

## Dashboard Routing Logic

The NavigationService routes all non-root users to `/dashboard`, and the DashboardScreen determines which specific dashboard to show:

```dart
// In DashboardScreen
switch (currentUser.role) {
  case UserRole.root:    → RootDashboard
  case UserRole.admin:   → CompanyDashboard  
  case UserRole.worker:  → AssociatedDashboard (Worker Dashboard)
  case UserRole.customer: → CustomerDashboard
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Accept Invitation:
1. Login as company admin
2. Invite a customer user to become a worker
3. Login as the customer user
4. Go to invitation notifications
5. Accept the invitation
6. **Expected Result**: 
   - Success dialog appears with two options
   - User can choose to continue as worker or logout and log in again
   - User is redirected accordingly

### Test Reject Invitation:
1. Follow steps 1-4 above
2. Reject the invitation
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Rejection message appears
   - User is redirected to CustomerDashboard
   - User remains a customer with customer features

## Files Modified

1. **lib/features/users/screens/invitation_notification_screen.dart**:
   - Robust navigation logic with user choice dialog
   - Provider services captured before async
   - All UI operations protected with context.mounted

2. **lib/core/services/auth_service.dart**:
   - `refreshUserData()` method to reload user data from Firestore

## Key Improvements

- ✅ **Predictable Navigation**: Clear logic for where users go after each action
- ✅ **Data Consistency**: User data is refreshed before navigation
- ✅ **Context Safety**: No more context disposal errors
- ✅ **User Choice**: Users can choose to logout or continue
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users always end up in the correct dashboard

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Users are now properly redirected and context disposal errors are resolved.
