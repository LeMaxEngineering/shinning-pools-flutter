## Session 2: Intensive Bug-Fixing & UX Overhaul
**Participants:** AI Assistant, Carlos (User)
**Objective:** Stabilize the application by fixing critical bugs and improving the user experience based on real-world testing.

**Key Activities & Resolutions:**

1.  **Company Management UI:**
    - **Diagnosis:** The root user's company list was basic and lacked professional features.
    - **Resolution:** Overhauled the `CompaniesListScreen`, replacing the `ListView` with a `DataTable`. Added a responsive statistics header and integrated edit/delete actions directly into the table rows.

2.  **Critical Login/Logout Failures:**
    - **Diagnosis:** A series of severe bugs were preventing users from logging in after logging out, often requiring a cache clear to proceed. The root cause was a combination of a deleted `auth_service.dart` file, state management race conditions, and improper handling of Firebase's web persistence.
    - **Resolution:**
        - Recreated the `auth_service.dart` file.
        - Made the `signIn` and `signOut` methods more robust, ensuring the application state is cleared correctly.
        - Implemented a more direct login flow that bypasses the problematic stream listeners that were causing the race condition.
        - Fixed the browser caching issue by ensuring the app's state is definitively reset on logout.

3.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - **Diagnosis:** Several screens had layout overflows and usability issues.
    - **Resolution:**
        - Fixed the `ProfileScreen` `AppBar` by using a `PopupMenuButton` for actions.
        - Made the `CompaniesListScreen` stats header and `DataTable` fully responsive and scrollable to prevent overflow on smaller screens.
        - Implemented a global background image to create a more polished and consistent look.
        - Fixed a bug on the `CustomerDashboard` where the "Register Company" button would remain visible after a request was sent.

4.  **Database & Security:**
    - **Diagnosis:** Encountered `permission-denied` errors from Firestore and data type mismatches.
    - **Resolution:**
        - Corrected the Firestore security rules to properly validate the 'root' user role.
        - Fixed the `Company` model to correctly parse `Timestamp` objects from Firestore into `DateTime` objects.

**Outcome:** The application is now significantly more stable, professional, and user-friendly. The critical authentication bugs have been resolved, and the company management interface is feature-complete and robust.

## Session 21: Worker Avatar Initials Bug Fix (June 2025)
**Participants:** AI Assistant, Carlos (User)
**Objective:** Ensure worker avatars on the Manage Workers page display initials if no photo is present, or the profile photo if available.

**Issue Identified:**
- User reported that worker avatars were showing as solid blue circles, not initials or profile photos, even when no photo was set.
- The code only showed initials if `photoUrl` was `null`, but in the database, `photoUrl` was often an empty string (`""`).

**Resolution:**
- Updated the `CircleAvatar` logic in `associated_list_screen.dart` to treat both `null` and empty string as "no photo".
- Now, if `photoUrl` is `null` or `""`, the worker's initials (from their name) are shown. If a valid `photoUrl` is present, the profile photo is displayed.
- User confirmed the change request and the code was updated accordingly.

**Code Snippet:**
```dart
CircleAvatar(
  backgroundColor: AppColors.primary,
  backgroundImage: (worker.photoUrl != null && worker.photoUrl!.isNotEmpty)
      ? NetworkImage(worker.photoUrl!)
      : null,
  child: (worker.photoUrl == null || worker.photoUrl!.isEmpty)
      ? Text(
          _getInitials(worker.name),
          style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, fontSize: 18),
        )
      : null,
),
```

**Outcome:**
- The Manage Workers page now correctly displays either the worker's initials or their profile photo, improving the user experience and visual clarity.
- This fix ensures consistent avatar behavior regardless of how the `photoUrl` field is set in Firestore.
