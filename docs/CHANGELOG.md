- **Critical setState() Build Error Resolution**
  - ✅ **CustomerViewModel**: Fixed `loadCustomerName()` method to prevent setState during build
  - ✅ **CustomerViewModel**: Added post-frame callbacks to stream listeners to prevent build-time state updates
  - ✅ **InvitationViewModel**: Added post-frame callbacks to stream listeners for consistent error prevention
  - ✅ **WorkerViewModel**: Fixed stream listener in `loadWorkers()` method to use post-frame callbacks
  - ✅ **PoolService**: Fixed `initializePoolsStream()` method to use post-frame callbacks in stream listeners
  - ✅ **AuthService**: Fixed `_onAuthStateChanged()` method to use post-frame callbacks in Firebase auth state listener
  - ✅ **Associated Dashboard**: Fixed stream listeners (`_setupRealtimeListeners`) to use post-frame callbacks
  - ✅ **Company Dashboard**: Fixed listener callbacks (`_onCustomersChanged`, `_onPoolsChanged`, `_onWorkersChanged`) to use post-frame callbacks
  - ✅ **Pool Form Screen**: Changed from direct Provider access to Consumer widget to prevent setState during build

- **Compilation Error Fix**
  - ✅ **Maintenance Details Screen**: Fixed type error in `_prettifyKey()` method where `replaceFirst` was returning `dynamic` instead of `String`
  - ✅ **Type Safety**: Improved string manipulation method to ensure proper type handling
