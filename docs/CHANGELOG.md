## [1.3.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Fixed
- **Complete Compilation Error Resolution**
  - ✅ **Fixed conflicting `fromFirestore` methods** in `AppUser` class - Removed static method, kept factory method
  - ✅ **Added missing `currentUser` getter** in `FirebaseAuthRepository` for Firebase user access
  - ✅ **Standardized navigation routes** - All routes now use consistent `/dashboard` pattern
  - ✅ **Fixed type mismatches** between Firebase `User` and `AppUser` in ViewModels
  - ✅ **Resolved missing required parameters** in invitation creation flow
  - ✅ **Added missing `companyName` and `name` fields** to `AppUser` model
  - ✅ **Updated ViewModels** to use `AuthService` instead of `FirebaseAuthRepository`
  - ✅ **Centralized invitation logic** in `WorkerViewModel` to eliminate code duplication
  - ✅ **Fixed method signature conflicts** in invitation-related classes
  - ✅ **Resolved missing repository imports** and fields in UI screens

### Technical Improvements
- **Project Compilation Status**: ✅ **0 compilation errors** - Project now compiles successfully
- **Static Analysis**: 154 warnings/info messages (all non-blocking)
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced maintainability and consistency
- **Dependency Injection**: Corrected ViewModel dependencies in `main.dart`
- **Authentication Flow**: Unified and stabilized across all screens

### Development Status

- **Compilation**: ✅ **Successful with 0 errors**
- **Testing Ready**: ✅ **Ready for comprehensive testing**
- **Next Phase**: Pool Management feature development

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Fixed
- **Worker Invitation Flow**
  - Resolved `permission-denied` errors during invitation creation by correcting Firestore security rules for `users` and `pools` collections.
  - Fixed a bug where `invitedUserId` was saved as an empty string. The repository now correctly looks up the user's ID by email.
  - Corrected an issue where the company name was appearing as "Unknown Company" on the invitation screen.
  - Fixed a UI bug where the "Reject" button was not styled correctly.
  - Resolved a "Bad state: No element" error when accepting/rejecting invitations by fetching the invitation directly from the repository.
- **UI State Management**
  - Fixed a bug where the invitation screen would remain after being rejected.
  - Corrected a bug where the invitation screen would get stuck after being accepted, by allowing the app's main auth flow to handle navigation.

### Technical Improvements
- **Firestore Security Rules**
  - Refined security rules to be more explicit and secure, separating `get` and `list` permissions for `users` and `pools` collections.
- **State Management**
  - Improved the `InvitationViewModel` to handle state changes more robustly after accepting or rejecting an invitation.

  - Fixed email verification screen to check `currentUser.emailVerified`

### Technical Improvements
